# Social

Social is a social media application where you can register, login, post your thoughts, delete or edit your posts, follow/unfollow other people and like/unlike posts.

Social is an application that allows users to interact with each other.

## Technologies

To develop this application I have used:

- database: Postgresql
- Django
- Javascript 

The application has pagination, developed with Django pagination and javascript. The interactivity is mostly due to javascript that listens to clicks on buttons or icons and fetches the information from the backend using AJAX.
